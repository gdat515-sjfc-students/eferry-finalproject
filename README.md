##Final project

Statement of Work: My final project will use visualization to explore avacoado data. Using a free kaggle dataset as well as publicly availble Hass Avocado Board data containing weekly 2018 reatil scan data for National Retail volume and price,  I will show a series of charts and graphics which attempt to understand the realationship between consumers and purchasing behavior. 

Problem Statement: The main question I am looking to awnser is the typical purchasing behavoir associated with buying an avocado. Are they typically purcahsed in bulk, organically, seasonally, what region has the highest number of avocado purchases and what price point generates the higest sale of product. Essentially this information could be used to predict 2019 avocado sales and help inform marketing tactics across the board. 


Technical Objectives: Environment: I will use an Rmarkdown document to create an interactive flexdashboard. Data Sources: This data was sourced from the HAB (Hass Avocado Board)https://hassavocadoboard.com/(for 2019 purchasing information) and from Kaggle (open data source)https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices. Primary Package Dependencies: Tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, plotly)
